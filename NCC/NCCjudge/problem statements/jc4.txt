Having recently learnt the concept of sieving to generate prime numbers and having solved Prime Queries from a recent long challenge, Abizer is high on his knowledge of prime numbers and claims to know everything about them.
His friend ,Chinmay therefore asked him to answer a simple question.
Chinmay gave Abizer a number N and asked him if it was possible for him to express it as a sum of 2 prime numbers. 
Abizer,with all his knowledge, was stumped so he asked his fellow teammate, Kedar to help him out with the question.

Input format:
First line contains the number of test cases,T.
Each test case contains a single integer, N.

Output format:
If the number N can be represented as a sum of 2 prime numbers, print "YES" without quotes.
Else print "NO".
