Anuj's father works in Merchant Navy. His father presented Anuj with a problem about the cargo his crew was pondering over.
The problem goes as follows:
Some balls are to be put into crates, and these crates put into ships. A ship can have k number of crates only if there exists a ship with k-1 number of crates, and a crate can have p balls if there exists a crate with p-1 balls in the same ship. No ship can have 0 crates and no crate can have 0 balls. Given the number of ships N, the crew is allowed to use as many crates and ships as permitted. What is the maximum number of balls the crew can store?
Since Anuj is not that good with mathematical puzzles, he asked his mathemagician friend Shubham to help him answer the question.
Print the answer modulo 10^9+7
