Ankit loves strings, especially strings that are palindromic. Ajay on the other hand loves odd numbers, so both of them decided to combine their respective love for palindromic strings and odd numbers to create a question for the Clash Final.
For a given integer N, find the Nth smallest odd length palindrome consisting of lowercase english alphabets.
1) A string of length L(odd) comes before a string of length L+2.
2) N'th palindromes are sorted lexicographically.
Having made the question, both of them realised they couldnt formulate a solution to solve it.
Help them out by printing the N'th smallest odd length palindrome pertaining to the given conditions.

Input format:
First line contains the number of test cases, T.
Each test case contains a single integer, N.

Output format:
Print the N'th smallest odd length palindrome pertaining to the given conditions.

Constraints
