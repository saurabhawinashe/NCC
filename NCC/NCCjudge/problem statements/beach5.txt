A year ago on the bench in PICT college campus, Akash found an array of n numbers. He believes that permutation p is right if for all 1 ≤ i < n condition, that a[i]*(a[i+1]) is not a perfect square, holds. Akash wants to find number of right permutations modulo 10^9 + 7.
Since answering it was beyond him, Subodh stepped in to help him out with it.

Input format:
First line contains number of test cases,T
Second line of input data contains single integer n-the number of elements in the array

Next line contains n integers a1,a2,...,an-the found array

Output format:
Output a single integer - number of right permutation modulo 10^9+7

Constraints
1<=T<=50
1<=n<=300
1<=ai<=10^9

Sample:
Input:
2
3
1 2 4
7
5 2 4 2 4 1 1

Output:
2
144
